# Churn_Analysis

# Objective
The objective of this project is to identify significant factors influencing customer churn in the banking sector and to provide actionable insights for improving customer retention strategies using survival analysis techniques.

# Project Overview
This project aims to analyze customer churn in the banking sector by employing various survival analysis methods. The primary goal is to understand the factors contributing to customer churn and offer insights that can help in formulating effective customer retention strategies.

# Key Highlights
Parametric Models: Evaluated several parametric models for churn modeling. The Weibull distribution was identified as optimal based on the lowest AIC and BIC values.
Model Performance: Noted limitations in model performance from negative log-likelihood values.
Survival Functions: Utilized non-parametric and semi-parametric methods to plot survival functions, offering insights into significant factors influencing customer churn such as gender, age, geography, account balance, complaints, credit score, and card type.

# Methodology
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned and prepared the dataset for analysis.
Parametric Modeling: Evaluated several parametric models, identifying the Weibull distribution as optimal based on AIC and BIC values.
Survival Analysis: Applied non-parametric (Kaplan-Meier) and semi-parametric (Cox Proportional-Hazards) methods to plot survival functions and analyze significant factors.
Insights and Recommendations: Derived actionable insights to improve customer retention strategies based on the analysis.

# Results
The Weibull distribution was found to be the best fit for parametric modeling, though it exhibited some performance limitations.
Non-parametric and semi-parametric survival functions revealed significant factors influencing customer churn, providing valuable insights for customer retention strategies.

# Conclusion
This project demonstrates the application of survival analysis techniques to understand customer churn in the banking sector. The insights derived can help in developing effective customer retention strategies by focusing on significant factors such as gender, age, geography, account balance, complaints, credit score, and card type.
